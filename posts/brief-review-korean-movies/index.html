Actually I have already watched a lot korean drama since I was in elementary school because I was always losed the TV battle with my sister, so I was waiting the drama until the commercial break to watched my favorite program like Naruto while I enjoyed that drama too. Those Series that I only remembered were Dream High, Go joon Pyo, pasta, bread, brian legacy, full house, death bell. I think there&#39;s more but I just forgot about those. In Junior High School I thought that I didn&#39;t watched korean drama because I was busy to do other activities but in Senior High School I thought even I was busier than in JNH because I joined organizations, I&#39;d still have times to feel the boredom and check movies on my sister&#39;s notebook. And until now if I was boring, I check on my sister&#39;s notebook to copy the movies. (I never download by myself or search further about the update of korean series, SERIOUSLY MAN I AM NOT A KOREAWEEBS). And after that, I spent my time to watched it without any burden until now. I am sorry Ya Allah because I&#39;ve wasted my times on these things and I hope that I learn something by watching a lot of these 😀 So here&#39;s the list and brief review about korean movies that I have watched until now. Scandal Makers what i remembered is story about a radio anouncer who has a daughter when he was in high school and his daughter has a son when she was in junior high school. lots of comedy but i forgot whether the story is good or not hello ghost i don&#39;t want to spoil. dark comedy about a moron who always fail to suicide. it made me cry sunny about high school woman friendship and the struggle of mother raise his daughter a werewolf boy ​ ​ i have just realised that the wolf is who play in dots. very romance, didn&#39;t like it baby and me maybe about a gangster who babysite an unwanted baby. forgot about the plot windstruck silly, unlogic, full of drama, and has sad ending. about a policewoman who catch false thief and the love story began from there. what i liked is only the beutiful policewoman and the sad ending my sassy girl light comedy and silly. the girl is evil fffffffff. succeed made me cry miracle in cell no.7 there&#39;s a lot of person saying that they&#39;re crying in watching this. but sadly i&#39;m not, i don&#39;t know why. told about the disabilities father that been accused raping and murdering a child, while actually he didn&#39;t do it. train to busan not really into this kind of movie but not bad since i watched it together with my friend behind damri from bandung to cimahi and it was really like a scene in romcom movie but we&#39;re just friend anyway. oh forgot, i should have written this movie summary! so it is only about zombie parasite i don&#39;t know if this movie is overrated or not. very slow and boring in the beginning if you&#39;re not really into cinematography. but the story is quite original and contrast with any other movies and there is a little humour too. showing a lot of implied significances and one of the most appeling is the social discrepancy. magnificient! memories of murder very slow but this is really worth watching of bong joon-ho movies and based on true story about detectives who struggle catch the murderer oldboy The twist is not really legit but I like about some abstract scenes on this movie and the dialog.

And until now if I was boring, I check on my sister's notebook to copy the movies. (I never download by myself or search further about the update of korean series, SERIOUSLY MAN I AM NOT A KOREAWEEBS). And after that, I spent my time to watched it without any burden until now.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I am sorry Ya Allah because I've wasted my times on these things and I hope that I learn something by watching a lot of these 😀</p><p></p><p></p><p>So here's the list and brief review about korean movies that I have watched until now.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Scandal Makers</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/8b2c0d07fa663d2817e35d840693aa54.jpg" alt="scandal-maker" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>what i remembered is story about a radio anouncer who has a daughter when he was in high school and his daughter has a son when she was in junior high school. lots of comedy but i forgot whether the story is good or not</p><p></p><p></p><p>hello ghost</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/hello-ghost-2010.jpg" alt="hello-ghost-image" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>i don't want to spoil. dark comedy about a moron who always fail to suicide. it made me cry</p><p></p><p></p><p>sunny</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/fullsizephoto163724.jpg" alt="sunny" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>about high school woman friendship and the struggle of mother raise his daughter</p><p></p><p></p><p>a werewolf boy ​</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/4030.jpg" alt="" title="" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>​</p><p></p><p></p><p>i have just realised that the wolf is who play in dots. very romance, didn't like it</p><p></p><p></p><p>baby and me</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/baby_and_me-007.jpg" alt="baby-and-me" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>maybe about a gangster who babysite an unwanted baby. forgot about the plot</p><p></p><p></p><p>windstruck</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/windstruck-008.jpg" alt="windstruck" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>silly, unlogic, full of drama, and has sad ending. about a policewoman who catch false thief and the love story began from there. what i liked is only the beutiful policewoman and the sad ending</p><p></p><p></p><p>my sassy girl</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/my-sassy-girl.jpg" alt="my-sassy-girl" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>light comedy and silly. the girl is evil fffffffff. succeed made me cry</p><p></p><p></p><p>miracle in cell no.7</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/ujcnjrxhanjjp3l7eftd.jpg" alt="miracle-in-cell" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>there's a lot of person saying that they're crying in watching this. but sadly i'm not, i don't know why. told about the disabilities father that been accused raping and murdering a child, while actually he didn't do it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>train to busan</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image"><img data-src="https://muhammadichsanulamal.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/18223344883856383533.jpg" alt="train-to-busan" data-proofer-ignore></figure><p></p><p></p><p>not really into this kind of movie but not bad since i watched it together with my friend behind damri from bandung to cimahi and it was really like a scene in romcom movie but we're just friend anyway. oh forgot, i should have written this movie summary!

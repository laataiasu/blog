When I have an urge to cry, I always remind myself to look at the mirror. I am poor and and I don't have a mirror, so I just use my smartphone. I look at my camera, even with this beauty effect, I am still ugly. Ugly people don't deserve to cry. My self always looks funny. The ugly is not only in my face, everything about me is disgusting. So I hold myself to cry. 

Human relationship is futile.

I can't pretend that I don't want  to kill myself. The spontaneous act from me, I never thought about it, and somehow suddenly it's acted. Like I don't even know why I am doing that. The problem is not the spontaneous act, the problem is my brain think that as something inapproriaate. People have brain, I knew no one remember what I did, but the stupid brain of mine somehow can remember a lot of disgusting acts from others. And I consider everyone is just like me, very sensitive, unstable, analyzing and remembering everything well, even the most useless thing that happend in the world.

I knew I'm not that overpower as what I imagine can remember all the worst things happen in the world. But it turns out I am a religious person. Religios person must accept that there is someone bigger than us. And what would you expect if you can see everything, the most disgusting things happened in this world everyday. Not only in this world, but the omnipotent knows everything. What is the right pronounciation for the overpower matter? 

I don't know, my mind is fucked up. I can't contol this. I want to die. Please god, I want to die fastly in a khusnul hotimah way. I am useless. I don't have anything because I have everything that I need. I just want to kill you, I want to fuck you, a piece of shit insensitive prick. Just because you know everything, you act nothing. And I knew that yesterday I got something good. I eat healthy food with a good environment, I knew it. You might think that I am a greed that I want more. yes I want more, but it's not what you think about what I wanted. I just want to know, I just want to know whether you are real or not. I don't need a pricey thing, I don't need car, home, food, I just want to know. Or maybe that is the most expensive things. Only to know? so that you're hiding everything in your shit secret warehouse.

Ah fuck, guess I greed. Alright I am now grateful. I accept everything. I born again. And I still want to kill myself again
